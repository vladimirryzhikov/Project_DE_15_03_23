# Stock Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze historical stock data to gain insights and make informed investment decisions.

## Data

The project uses historical stock data obtained from various sources. The data is organized into folders named after the ticker symbols, and each folder contains the following CSV files:

- ticker.csv: Historical price data for the specified ticker symbol.
- ticker_shares.csv: Number of shares for the specified ticker symbol.
- ticker_earnings.csv: Earnings data for the specified ticker symbol.

## Analysis

The project analyzes the historical stock data to generate insights and make informed investment decisions. The analysis includes the following steps:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing: The raw data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure data quality and consistency.

2. Data exploration: The data is explored to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.

3. Feature engineering: Additional features are created from the existing data to improve the predictive power of the models.

4. Model selection and training: Various machine learning models are trained on the data to predict future stock prices.

5. Model evaluation: The trained models are evaluated to determine their accuracy and effectiveness in predicting future stock prices.

6. Investment strategy development: Based on the insights gained from the analysis, an investment strategy is developed to make informed investment decisions.

## Results

The project generates various visualizations and reports to communicate the results of the analysis. These include:

- Time series plots of the historical stock prices.
- Correlation matrix to identify relationships between different features.
- Feature importance plots to determine which features are most predictive.
- Predicted vs. actual stock price plots to evaluate the performance of the models.
