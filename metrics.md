# Metrics to measure

   1. Returns: Returns are a measure of the profit or loss that an investment generates over a given period of time. The most commonly used return metric is the percentage return, which is calculated as the percentage difference between the price at which an investment was bought and sold. This can be measured using the formula: ((final price - initial price) / initial price) * 100.

   2. Volatility: Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation of a stock's price over time. It is typically measured using the standard deviation of daily returns over a given period. Higher volatility means that the price of the stock is more likely to fluctuate in either direction. This can be measured using the formula: sqrt(variance of daily returns) * sqrt(252) (where 252 represents the number of trading days in a year).

   3. Sharpe Ratio: The Sharpe ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return that takes into account the volatility of the stock. It is calculated by dividing the excess return (i.e., the return of the stock over the risk-free rate) by the standard deviation of the returns. This can be measured using the formula: (average daily return - risk-free rate) / (standard deviation of daily returns).

   4. Beta: Beta is a measure of the volatility of a stock relative to the market. A beta of 1 means that the stock moves in tandem with the market, while a beta of less than 1 means that the stock is less volatile than the market and a beta of greater than 1 means that the stock is more volatile than the market. This can be measured using regression analysis, where the stock's daily returns are regressed against the market's daily returns.

   5. P/E Ratio: The P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio is a valuation metric that compares the price of a stock to its earnings per share. It is calculated by dividing the stock's current price by its earnings per share (EPS) over the last 12 months. A higher P/E ratio indicates that the stock is more expensive relative to its earnings, while a lower P/E ratio indicates that the stock is cheaper.

   6. Dividend Yield: The dividend yield is a measure of the income generated by a stock, expressed as a percentage of its current price. It is calculated by dividing the annual dividend per share by the stock's current price. A higher dividend yield indicates that the stock is generating more income for its shareholders.
